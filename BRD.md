- **FR-001.2:** Users can login and receive JWT tokens
- **FR-001.3:** JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- **FR-001.4:** Protected endpoints require valid JWT tokens

### 3.2 Task Management (FR-002)
- **FR-002.1:** Users can create tasks with title, description, and due date
- **FR-002.2:** Users can view all their tasks
- **FR-002.3:** Users can view a specific task by ID
- **FR-002.4:** Users can update task details
- **FR-002.5:** Users can delete tasks
- **FR-002.6:** Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete

### 3.3 Task Status Tracking (FR-003)
- **FR-003.1:** Tasks have status: "pending", "in_progress", "completed"
- **FR-003.2:** Tasks have priority: "low", "medium", "high"
- **FR-003.3:** Users can filter tasks by status and priority
- **FR-003.4:** Users can search tasks by title or description

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance (NFR-001)
- API response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Support up to 100 concurrent users
- Database queries optimized for performance

### 4.2 Security (NFR-002)
- All passwords hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens signed with secret key
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection

### 4.3 Reliability (NFR-003)
- 99.5% uptime availability
- Graceful error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4.4 Maintainability (NFR-004)
- Code coverage > 85%
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Clean, readable code with proper comments

---

## 5. Technical Constraints

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** SQLite (for demo simplicity)
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens
- **Testing:** pytest
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger

---

## 6. API Endpoints Specification

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login

### Task Endpoints (Protected)
- `GET /tasks` - List all user tasks (with filtering)
- `POST /tasks` - Create new task
- `GET /tasks/{task_id}` - Get specific task
- `PUT /tasks/{task_id}` - Update task
- `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` - Delete task
- `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}/status` - Update task status

---

## 7. Data Models

### User Model
```json
{
  "id": "integer",
  "email": "string (unique)",
  "password_hash": "string",
  "created_at": "datetime",
  "updated_at": "datetime"
}
```

### Task Model
```json
{
  "id": "integer",
  "user_id": "integer (foreign key)",
  "title": "string (required, max 200 chars)",
  "description": "string (optional, max 1000 chars)",
  "status": "enum (pending, in_progress, completed)",
  "priority": "enum (low, medium, high)",
  "due_date": "datetime (optional)",
  "created_at": "datetime",
  "updated_at": "datetime"
}
```

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: User Registration
- Given a new user with valid email and password
- When they register via POST /auth/register
- Then a new user account is created
- And they receive a success response

### AC-002: User Login
- Given a registered user with correct credentials
- When they login via POST /auth/login
- Then they receive a valid JWT token
- And the token can be used for protected endpoints

### AC-003: Task Creation
- Given an authenticated user
- When they create a task with valid data
- Then the task is saved to the database
- And they receive the created task with ID

### AC-004: Task Listing
- Given an authenticated user with existing tasks
- When they request GET /tasks
- Then they receive all their tasks
- And tasks from other users are not included

### AC-005: Task Filtering
- Given an authenticated user with tasks of different statuses
- When they request GET /tasks?status=completed
- Then they receive only completed tasks

### AC-006: Task Update
- Given an authenticated user with an existing task
- When they update the task via PUT /tasks/{id}
- Then the task is updated in the database
- And they receive the updated task

### AC-007: Task Deletion
- Given an authenticated user with an existing task
- When they delete the task via DELETE /tasks/{id}
- Then the task is removed from the database
- And they receive a success response

---

## 9. Error Handling Requirements

- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid input data
- **401 Unauthorized:** Missing or invalid JWT token
- **403 Forbidden:** User doesn't own the resource
- **404 Not Found:** Resource doesn't exist
- **422 Unprocessable Entity:** Validation errors
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Unexpected server errors

---

## 10. Success Metrics

- All acceptance criteria pass automated tests
- Code coverage > 85%
- API documentation is complete and accurate
- Application deploys successfully
- All endpoints respond within performance requirements

---

## 11. Out of Scope

- User profile management beyond basic auth
- Task sharing between users
- Email notifications
- File attachments to tasks
- Advanced reporting features

---

## 12. Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users have basic understanding of REST APIs
- JWT tokens are stored securely by clients
- Database will be reset for each demo
- No user data persistence required beyond demo

---

## 13. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Authentication complexity | Medium | Low | Use proven JWT library |
| Database performance | Low | Low | Use simple SQLite for demo |
| API design inconsistency | Medium | Medium | Follow REST conventions strictly |
| Testing complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with simple test cases |

---

## 14. Approval

This BRD serves as the foundation for demonstrating AI agent capabilities in software development. All requirements are designed to showcase key development workflows including TDD, debugging, code review, and deployment.
